# Skyrat-tg Quirk Overrides Module

This module is the receptacle for overriding new quirks (and their dependencies).

If you want to override a stock TG quirk or one of it's vars/procs/behaviors, this is the module to use.

If you're trying to add a new Quirk, see the (Skyrat-tg Quirk Additions Module)[/]
