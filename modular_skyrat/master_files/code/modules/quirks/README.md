# Skyrat-tg Quirk Overrides Module

This module is the receptacle for overriding pre-existing TG Quirks.

If you want to override a stock TG quirk or one of it's vars/procs/behaviors, this is the module to use.

If you're trying to add a new Quirk, see the (Skyrat-tg Quirk Additions Module)[/modular_skyrat/modules/quirks/README.md]
