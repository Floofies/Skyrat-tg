## \<Title Piles a.k.a. Tiny Stacks>

Module ID: PILES

### Description:

This module adds an `/obj/item/pile` class which allows specific items to be stacked into small "piles".

Piles are "loose" by default, meaning they only stay together while in-hand or while in a bag. Loose piles may separate apart as individual items when dropped, or when one is put into a box.
