## \<Title Tiny Item Stacks> <!--Title of your addition.-->

Module ID: TINY_STACKS

### Description:

This module adds subclasses for *pills* and *bullets* which allow them to be stacked while in-hand.

### TG Proc/File Changes:

- TODO: Probably not
<!-- If you edited any core procs, you should list them here. You should specify the files and procs you changed.
E.g: 
- `code/modules/mob/living.dm`: `proc/overriden_proc`, `var/overriden_var`
-->

### Modular Overrides:

- TODO: Yeah we're going to do some of that
<!-- If you added a new modular override (file or code-wise) for your module, you should list it here. Code files should specify what procs they changed, in case of multiple modules using the same file.
E.g: 
- `modular_skyrat/master_files/sound/my_cool_sound.ogg`
- `modular_skyrat/master_files/code/my_modular_override.dm`: `proc/overriden_proc`, `var/overriden_var`
-->

### Defines:

- TODO: Unlikely
<!-- If you needed to add any defines, mention the files you added those defines in, along with the name of the defines. -->

### Included files that are not contained in this module:

- N/A
<!-- Likewise, be it a non-modular file or a modular one that's not contained within the folder belonging to this specific module, it should be mentioned here. Good examples are icons or sounds that are used between multiple modules, or other such edge-cases. -->

### Credits:

I copied some of techniques which were originally used to implement `/obj/item/toy/cards`
<!-- Here go the credits to you, dear coder, and in case of collaborative work or ports, credits to the original source of the code. -->
